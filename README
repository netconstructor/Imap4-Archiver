This script will auto-archive email you have sitting on an IMAP4 server.  By default it's set for anything older than 30 days will go into a newly named folder with those messages.

Requires the following perl libraries:
* Net-Imap-Simple

1) Edit the script for your username/password/hostname/etc.
2) Cron it up.

Are there other/better/different ways to do this?  Yes.  But that's the case with most things.  I made it and it's handy for me.
